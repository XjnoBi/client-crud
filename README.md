# Additional notes

1. If time wasn't a constraint, what else would you have done?
   - I would've managed pagination in the backend to keep the responses reasonably small upon scaling up.
   - I would've created more custom components e.g. custom table to standardize the approach for all FE devs.
   - I would've covered the update and delete features also, since the mock API already handles it.
   - I would've cleaned up unused lines of codes after refactoring to use react-query for server-state management.
   - I would've added test coverages to ensure components are running as intended.
2. How was this test overall? I.e. too hard, too easy, how long it took, etc.
   - The required features are pretty straight forward. The fun starts on trying to meet the "Extras".
   - I'm not quite sure how long it took me to complete the exam, since I wasn't able to work on it continuously.
   - It was fun working on this exam. I think it was great that the initial setup was done already, and just needed to work on the requirements straight away.
